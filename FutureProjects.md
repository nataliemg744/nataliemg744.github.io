## Access to Video Games in Childhood vs Violent Behavior in Adult Hood
A comparative analysis on whether or not individuals played video games in their adolescence (<18 years old) and whether or not they have been diagnosed with anger issues or been convicted of violent crimes. The questionaire will consider which games, if any, were played and take into account their age ratings and disclosures to sort them into violent and non-violent categories.
